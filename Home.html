            Ultimate Frisbee is a sport that I never played myself, but it's popularity is something hard to ignore in
            many Midwestern college towns. Students (and people who wish they were still students) spend the few
            briefs months of good weather, sprinting down fields, hurling frisbees, and yelling "Stack!!"</p>
        <p class="paul2">What I find much more entertaining is the large number of people who continue to play when the
            weather gets windy and the night sky darkens around oh...4:15pm. The sight of frisbees boomeranging
            in the wind is topped only by the knowledge that even when you can't seem, those same plastic discs of
            death are probably hurtling through the dark night sky at 8 or 9 o'clock in the evening.</p>
        <p>Ultimate Frisbee requires a great deal of stamina and dexterity. Not surprisingly, the IOC officially
            recognized Ultimate as a sport in 2015. It can go up against other sports for inclusion in Olympic games.</p>
