        Please can you help me purchase an Itunes gift card from the store or online for my niece as a birthday gift? I don’t know what’s wrong with my Amazon account. It's not going through and its seems like Amazon now takes several hours or days to deliver the gift card to the recipient email address, so i’d appreciate if you can try getting them online on this site (mygiftcardsupply.com), I have called Amazon but it has not been resolved yet. I'm not feeling well and will not be able to go to the store. I'll pay back as soon as I get better.
        
        Thank you,

        Dear Gary Fordham. 
        
        Thanks for your response to my email. I know my email may come to you as a surprise. I am Mrs Mary Abel, an aging widow of 74 years old, a British citizen suffering from long time illness and I am currently admitted in a private hospital here in Abidjan Cote D'Ivoire.
        
        I have some funds I inherited from my late loving husband, the sum of US$ 4.700.000 which he deposited with a bank in Abidjan. I am looking for a honest and God fearing person that can use these funds for God's work and 15% out of the total funds will be for your compensation for doing this work.
        
        Please let me know if you can be able to do this work so that I will give you more detail how the project could be done.
        
        Sincerely,
        
        Mrs Mary Abel. 
        
        
        
        Dear Pastor Gary Fordham.

        Please can you help me purchase an Itunes gift card from the store or online for my niece as a birthday gift? I don’t know what’s wrong with my Amazon account. It's not going through and its seems like Amazon now takes several hours or days to deliver the gift card to the recipient email address, so i’d appreciate if you can try getting them online on this site (mygiftcardsupply.com), I have called Amazon but it has not been resolved yet. I'm not feeling well and will not be able to go to the store. I'll pay back as soon as I get better.

        Dear Gary Fordham. 
        
        Thanks for your response to my email. I know my email may come to you as a surprise. I am Mrs Mary Abel, an aging widow of 74 years old, a British citizen suffering from long time illness and I am currently admitted in a private hospital here in Abidjan Cote D'Ivoire.
        
        I have some funds I inherited from my late loving husband, the sum of US$ 4.700.000 which he deposited with a bank in Abidjan. I am looking for a honest and God fearing person that can use these funds for God's work and 15% out of the total funds will be for your compensation for doing this work.
        
        Please let me know if you can be able to do this work so that I will give you more detail how the project could be done.
        
        Sincerely,
        
        Mrs Mary Abel.
